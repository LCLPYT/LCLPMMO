### For players:<br>
Read the [installation instructions](https://lclpnet.work/lclpserver/5.0#installationTitle)

### For developers / Modpack creators
This mod depends on <a href="https://github.com/LCLPYT/CoreBase">CoreBase</a> and it's dependencies.
Until 1.16, this mod also requires <a href="https://github.com/LXGaming/MixinBootstrap">MixinBootstrap</a> (also a dependency of CoreBase).
From 1.16 and upwards, MixinBootstrap is no longer required, since <a href="https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge">MinecraftForge</a> supports Mixins themselves.
